Excited to share my latest Java-based project - the classic Snake Game! 🐍
Here are some of its features:
- The game starts with a snake of size 3 (including its head), which moves in the direction the user chooses with arrow keys.
- Apples are randomly generated within the frame.
- After consuming an apple, the snake's size increases by one.
- If the snake collides with either the walls or itself, the game ends, and your points are displayed along with "Game Over".
